text="Holy smokes! It's time to release!

After what seems to have been an eternity, we're finally looking at QuickBox Pro v3.0.0.

We're very excited to have v3 launched and we're very excited to have you join us!

Should you encounter any issues, please let us know. Even though there has been an incredible
amount of testing, there may still be some bugs. This can happen depending on the environment
, the OS, the hardware, package maintainers updating things, and any number of variables. 
In short, it's Linux and anything can happen. All issues are tracked and will be resolved as
quickly as possible.

With the usual bug disclaimer out of the way. Enjoy and we look forward to many more releases in the future."
