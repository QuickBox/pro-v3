text="soon to enter the test phase
As we near the finish line, QuickBox Pro will be going into the beta testing phase over the next couple of weeks.

We continue to work on quality control where we encounter a need for it. The initial testing phases should be fast.
Once v3 passes the initial testing phase, we will be launching v3 for new installs. The aim is to complete the upgrade from v2 > v3 over the next month or so. This means, that anyone not wanting to do a fresh install will be able to upgrade their installs not long after the launch of v3. 

Stay tuned for more!"
