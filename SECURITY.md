# Security Policy

The following security policy covers the QuickBox Pro lineage of software.

## Supported Versions

Any security reports and subsequent patches are posted upstream on a rolling commit 
basis covering recent and latest versions as they are released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected 
security vulnerabilities should be reported to QuickBox.IO privately, to minimize attacks 
against current users of QuickBox before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be 
investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. 
This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for QuickBox Pro, 
please IMMEDIATELY contact sec@quickbox.io, or **create a [private issue within our GitLab](https://lab.quickbox.io/QuickBox/pro-v3/-/issues)**
to inform the QuickBox.IO Development Team.

*IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on our GitLab for security vulnerabilities*

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to sec@quickbox.io. 
You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, 
we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but 
historically within a few days.
